# comm4190_F25_TikTok_Task

This project examines how TikTok users respond to a video by creator Emma Natienza, in which she critiques the difficulty of achieving today’s modern beauty standards compared to those of the early 2000s. After the video circulated, many commenters also posted mourning messages due to Emma’s passing. This project explores whether TikTok comments were used to agree with Emma’s critique, while accounting for the presence of sympathy-related comments.
