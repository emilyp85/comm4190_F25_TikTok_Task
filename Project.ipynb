    "## 1. Video URL and Description\n",
    "* **Video URL:** https://www.tiktok.com/@emmanatienza/video/7532690746361515271?_r=1&_t=ZP-91GKRI4M1jb\n",
    "* **Description:** This video features Emma Natienza (the creator) speaking directly to the camera. She describes how today's modern beauty standards are much stricter and harder to achieve than the early 2000s' beauty standards. Also, comments reveal that Emma sadly passed away.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Research Question\n",
    "* **Research Question:** Do viewers use TikTok comments to agree with Emma's critique of modern beauty standards?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Concepts and How They Changed With Coding\n",
    "### Initial Definition:\n",
    "* **Concept 1** = \"code 1 if the comment explicitly expresses support for the creator's opinion; code 0 if the comment explicitly disagrees with the creator's opinion\"\n",
    "* **Concept 2** = \"code 1 if the comment is relevant to the video; code 0 if the comment is irrelevant to the video\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revised Definition:\n",
    "* **Concept 1** = \"Code 1 if the comment clearly and explicitly affirms or agrees with the creator’s stated opinion; code 0 if the comment clearly and explicitly rejects or disagrees with the creator’s stated opinion.\"\n",
    "* **Concept 2** = \"Code 1 if the comment directly references, responds to, or pertains to the video’s content or message; code 0 if the comment does not reference, respond to, or pertain to the video’s content or message.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Final LLM Prompt and Inter-Rater Reliability Scores\n",
    "* **Final Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You will code 100 social media comments for two concepts and then calculate interrater reliability. For Concept 1 (Support for the Creator’s Opinion), assign a 1 if the comment explicitly supports the creator’s opinion, such as statements like 'I agree,' 'You’re right,' or positive reactions and emojis (e.g., 👍😊❤️). Assign a 0 if the comment explicitly disagrees with the creator’s opinion, such as 'You’re wrong' or other negative or sarcastic responses. Comments expressing mourning or remembrance, such as 'RIP,' 'We miss you,' or 💔 emojis, should also be coded as 1 for Concept 1. For Concept 2 (Relevance to the Video), assign a 1 if the comment is relevant to the video’s topic or content—for example, if it refers to something said or shown in the video. Assign a 0 if the comment is irrelevant, off-topic, or consists only of emojis. Comments containing positive or smiling emojis (😊❤️) or mourning-related messages ('RIP,' 'We miss you,' 💔) should always be coded as 0 for Concept 2.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IRR Scores:** 0.79\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "I made the concepts more specific. I listed out examples and included emojis so that the LLM knew what to look for. I did this for both concepts. Neutral means no opinion but it can also mean something unrelated to which we defined. A difficult challenge we met was the fact that the creator died, so a lot of comments were \"RIP\" or anything sympathetic, which we had to account for in our concepts.\n",

    "## Answering Research Question\n",
    "The graphs demonstrate that most commenters actually did not pick a side—they remained neutral. This is evidence that the death of Emma, the creator of the video, actually outweighed the debate the video presents, which is the comparison of today's beauty standards to the early 2000s' beauty standards. If you disregard the death of Emma, the graphs actually demonstrate that concept 1 is higher than concept 2. This indicates that when commenters were engaging directly with the content rather than expressing sympathy, they were more likely to affirm Emma’s critique than to oppose it or simply comment on the topic without expressing a stance. Taken together, these results suggest that TikTok commenters do use the comment section to agree with Emma’s message—but this agreement is partially hidden by the large volume of sympathetic and mourning comments following her passing. When focusing only on comments actually responding to the video’s argument, viewer sentiment trends toward support for Emma’s critique of modern beauty standards."
